  # Restore tty flags
  # - If not, `exit` from INT trap might leave terminal in 'silent mode'
  #   (and nothing is echoed as user types).
  #   - E.g., if user <Ctrl-C>'s a `read -s` prompt.
  #   - SAVVY: Pro tip: If this ever happens to you, type `stty sane<CR>`
  #     to the terminal and hopefully that'll right the sh'ip.
  # - Note that `stty sane` also works here, but that's more like a reset.
  #   We use save-load to show that we restored the original tty settings.
