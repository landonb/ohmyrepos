# USAGE: Set Git user.email to user- and machine-specific address.
#
#        Useful for your private repos, so git-log shows `name@host` for Author.
#
#        E.g., this author keeps their private notes in one repository, and
#        that repository is shared between my development machines. Using
#        'username@machine' for the user.email means I can tell from which
#        machines I committed changes. Also, because for public repos I use
#        my GH user's shadow email (username@users.noreply.github.com,
#        specified from ~/.gitconfig.local, loaded globally by ~/.gitconfig),
#        now I can tell by the Git user that this is a private repo (which I
#        also indicate by the convention that in private repos I use the
#        branch name 'private').

# ISOFF/2024-02-19: This fcn. now deprecated.
# - Use instead .gitconfig [includeIf] config.
