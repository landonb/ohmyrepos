# Use skip_unless_archiving to disable a project unless MR_ARCHIVED set.
#
# - Use case: You don't normally want `mr -d /` to run on archival projects,
#   but you need some way to occasionally include those projects, e.g., when
#   running `MR_REMOTE=foo mr -d / ffssh` to backup your projects.
#
# Usage, e.g.,:
#
#   [/path/to/project]
#   ...
#   skip = skip_unless_archiving
#
# To reactivate projects disabled by skip_unless_archiving,
# set the MR_ARCHIVED environment, e.g.,:
#
#   MR_ARCHIVED=true mr -d /path/to/project foo

lib = skip_unless_archiving () { [ -z ${MR_ARCHIVED+x} ]; }
