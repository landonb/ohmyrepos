# Use no_travel for repos you want synced machine-to-machine, but not
# to a travel device.
#
# - Use case: Your travel device uses a tomb, which must be created with
#   a fixed size, and which takes longer to mount the larger the size,
#   and your USB device has limited capactity compared to machine disks,
#   so there are some projects you don't want to be synced to the travel
#   device.
#
# - Use case: You use an encrypted shadow repo to manage personal files
#   on a corporate device. On your personal machine, you have both the
#   encrypted and plaintext directories of the same repo, and you only
#   want to sync the plaintext directory to the (already) encrypted
#   travel device (and also the encrypted shadow repo grows hugely big
#   with every change).
#
# Usage, e.g.,:
#
#   [/path/to/project]
#   checkout = private_clone
#   skip = no_travel
#
# To disable no_travel, set the MR_ARCHIVED environment, e.g.,:
#
#   MR_ARCHIVED=1 mr -d /path/to/project ffssh
#
# no_travel: The project will be synced between hosts, but it won't be
# archived to the travel device.
lib =
  no_travel () {
    [ -z ${MR_ARCHIVED+x} ] &&
    [ -n "${MR_TRAVEL}" ]
  }
