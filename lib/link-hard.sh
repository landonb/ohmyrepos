# Pass in a the full path to the source file being hard linked ($1),
# and a partial path to the local deps/ file to create/maintain ($2).
# WHY: If you package shell or Git dependencies in source code of
# other projects and don't want to accidentally have different
# copies of the source diverge; and you only want search results
# from one copy of the file when grepping across projects.

# Note this doesn't know about update-faithful.sh
#   https://github.com/thegittinsgood/git-update-faithful#â›²
# Which otherwise supports a local file being at a known
# previous version of the file that it links.
# - The DepoXy environment uses a git post-rebase exec command
#   to ensure that hard links are never broken, so link_hard
#   conflicts should hopefully happen rarely. (Otherwise we
#   might consider adding update-faithful.sh-type awareness
#   to this feature.)

      # - This works well if you use link_hard to manage local deps.
      #   E.g., say you have a shell command project that uses multiple
      #   scripts from other projects. Rather than require end users to
      #   download multiple projects, you could create hard-links in the
      #   application repo to track each of the upstream dependencies.
      #   Whenever an upstream file changes, you just commit the local
      #   copy. If the local hard link breaks and the file is unchanged,
      #   it's safe to recreate the hard link, even if the source file
      #   is different.
      # - But the opposite scenario is not handled, and the user must
      #   resolve it manually. In this case, the file from the local
      #   repo is what's being placed somewhere else, outside the repo.
      #   This is useful for installing '.gitignore' files (which Git
      #   doesn't allow to be symlinked). You'd keep some _gitignore
      #   files locally in your repo that you hard-link where you need
      #   as '.gitignore' files. In this case, we don't want to clobber
      #   the destination, because it's outside this repo.
